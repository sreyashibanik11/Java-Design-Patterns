## Object Oriented Design Pattern Exercise 

## Introduction

A design pattern is a practical proven solution to a recurring design problem.
It allows you to use previously outlined solutions that expert developers have
often used to solve a software problem, so that you do not need to build a
solution from the basics of object-oriented programming principles every
time. These solutions are not just theoretical – they are actual solutions used
in the industry. Design patterns may also be used to help fix tangled,
structureless software code, also known as “spaghetti code”.
